2. Icon Size
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The icons have already been saved in 7 different sizes in increments of 5px, as follows:
35px, 40px ... 60px, 65px

The save method is Adobe Photoshop's 'Save for Web and Devices' as a PNG24 with Transparency. No 
interlacing has been added.

If you need the icons in an alternative size, follow the batch processing instructions below:

1.	Go into the psd/ folder and open up one of the icons using Adobe Photoshop.
2. 	Open the 'Actions' panel. If you don't see it go to Window > Actions.
3. 	Create a new Set using the 'Create new Set' button. Give it a descriptive name, e.g.
	"Icon Resizing".
4. 	Create a new Action using the 'Create new Action' button. Name it something like "48px".
	You should see the recording button light up. Your actions are now being recorded.
5.	Change the icon size via Image > Image Size, and enter whatever size you like.
6. 	Save the icon using File > Save for Web & Devices in whatever format you prefer.
	PNG24 is recommended.
7.	Stop the recording by hitting the 'Stop playing/ recording' button under the Actions panel.
8.	Select File > Automate > Batch
9.	Select your Set and Action and choose the psd/ folder (which contains the icons).
	Leave all checkboxes unchecked.
10.	Choose your destination, e.g. png/48px/ and check 'Override Action "Save As" commands.
11. 	File Naming should be "Document Name" + "extension".
12.	Click OK. The batch processor will now perform your Action on all of the icons.
