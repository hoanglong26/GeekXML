								<p>NBA 2K18 is a hardcore sports simulation. If you want to get good, you have to put in the work. Fortunately, there
									are plenty of ways to improve your skills no matter how you want to play. And the fact that there's so much to do
									is a bonus, because on the court, NBA 2K18 is also an amazingly well-crafted experience.</p>
								<p dir="ltr">The first thing that strikes you is how it looks and feels like a real-life professional basketball game. The 2K
									series' attention to detail has always been incredible, and this year is the best yet. Using the default camera,
									it's almost hard to discern between the game and an actual NBA broadcast. Great, varied commentary and the three-way
									chemistry of Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O'Neal during halftime make it feel like a Thursday night
									ballgame on TNT.</p>
								<p dir="ltr">NBA 2K18 is also on Nintendo's less powerful Switch, but don't discount that version: it still looks great for what
									it is, even if it falls short of its bigger brothers. Of course, there's the added bonus of playing in portable
									mode, which also helps diminish graphical flaws given the Switch's small screen.</p>
