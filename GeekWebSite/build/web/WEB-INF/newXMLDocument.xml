        <description>The follow-up to Half-Life continues the intense action and immersive storytelling from the original and adds more realism and responsiveness.  Once again, you play the role of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, and its populace dwindling.  With your trusty crowbar and a variety of other weapons at your disposal, Freeman must rescue the world from the wrong he unleashed at Black Mesa.</description>

        <description>LIBERTY CITY, USA. WELCOME TO AMERICA''S WORST CITY.You''ve been betrayed and left for dead. Now you''re taking revenge, unless the city gets you first. Mob bosses need a favor, crooked cops need help and street gangs want you dead. You''ll have to rob, steal and kill just to stay out of serious trouble. Anything can happen out here.Featuring a fully 3-D living city, a combination of narrative driven and non-linear gameplay and a completely open environment, Grand Theft Auto III represents a huge leap forward in interactive entertainment. For the first time, players are put at the heart of their very own gangster movie, and let loose in a fully-realised 3 dimensional city, in which anything can happen and probably will.With a cast of hundreds, 50 plus vehicles, ranging from sports cars to ice cream trucks and from boats to buses, 3 hours of music, including opera, reggae, house, drum and bass, pop and disco, a huge array of street ready weapons and some of the seediest characters in video game history, Grand Theft Auto 3 is a sprawling epic which will show you that sometimes, crime can pay and sometimes it can pay you back.</description>

        <description>Los Santos: a sprawling sun-soaked metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities, once the envy of the Western world, now struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV.Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.The biggest, most dynamic and most diverse open world ever created, Grand Theft Auto V blends storytelling and gameplay in new ways as players repeatedly jump in and out of the lives of the game''s three lead characters, playing all sides of the game''s interwoven story.All the classic hallmarks of the groundbreaking series return, including incredible attention to detail and Grand Theft Auto''s darkly humorous take on modern culture, alongside a brand new and ambitious approach to open world multiplayer.</description>

        <description>In LittleBigPlanet Players meet on a blue and green planet scattered with individual plots - and use their character''s amazing abilities to play, create and share what they build with other gamers throughout the world via the Playstation Network. The LittleBigPlanet experience starts with players learning about their character''s powers to interact physically with the environment. There are places to explore, creative resources to collect and puzzles to solve - all requiring a combination of brains and collaborative teamwork. As soon as players begin their creative skills will grow and they will soon be ready to start creating and modifying their surroundings - the first step to sharing them with the whole community. Characters have the power to move anything in this glued and stitched-together 3D landscape; they have the power to design, shape and build both objects and entire locations for others to view and play. There''s no complicated level editor; all of these skills can be learned by simply playing the game. Creativity is part of the gameplay experience and playing is part of the creative experience. Players can make their world as open or as secretive to explore as they like. When it''s ready, they can invite anyone within the LittleBigPlanet community to come and explore their patch - or can go and explore everybody else''s.</description>

        <description>From the dark and seedy streets of Liberty City''s underworld to the glamorous hedonism of Vice City of the 1980s, the Grand Theft Auto double-pack takes you through the huge worlds of Grand Theft Auto III and it''s sequel Vice City. The highly controversial Grand Theft Auto III gives you the freedom to go anywhere and jack anyone, putting the dark, intriguing and ruthless world of crime at your fingertips. Vice City is an entirely new game set in the ''80s, preserving and adding to the free-roaming gameplay, cinematic graphics and immersive audio experience that made the Grand Theft Auto III so popular.</description>
